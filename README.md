# Project-Optimization
Constructed mathematical models for task scheduling problems and developed programs to automatically compute a solution and optimize it using constraint programming and algorithms, comparing the two methods for solving this type of problems.

The work statement and report are in Portuguese.


## Implementation
Made with Prolog, ECLiPSe CLP and C++.
